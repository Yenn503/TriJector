ðŸš€ TriJector

TriJector is a lightweight Windows loader that demonstrates three core process injection techniques. Built primarily for educational and red team research use, this tool offers a modular and clear starting point for deeper exploration into advanced injection and evasion methods.

ðŸ”§ Features

â€¢ Win32 API Injection
â€¢ NTAPI Injection
â€¢ Direct Syscall Injection

ðŸ’¡ Purpose

This project is meticulously designed to:

    Help students and security researchers grasp the intricacies of low-level Windows injection methods.

    Serve as a robust base for developing more sophisticated loaders, bypass techniques, or custom implants.

    Clearly demonstrate the operational distinctions between userland (Win32 API), native API, and direct syscall injection.
